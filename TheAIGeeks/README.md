## ✨ What is CleverMart?

*CleverMart* is a dual-mode shop-management solution:

| Role            | Experience                                                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Owner** | Manage products, inventory, vendors, and sales analytics—right from Power Apps |
| **Customer**        | Scan a QR code and chat/voice with an AI assistant to browse items, place orders, and receive invoices |

Behind the scenes, Copilot Studio serves as the **virtual General Manager**, while Power Automate orchestrates orders, invoicing, and stock alerts.
